## Advent of Code 2024
This winter I am trying to learn `golang` with AoC 2024!

### Solutions
#### Day 1
Brute force the answer.
#### Day 2
Brute force check for all possible cases.
#### Day 3
Use regex to extract valid `muls` and functions `do()` & `don't()`.
#### Day 4
Pivot on `X` in first part and `A` in second part for the search.
#### Day 5
Create an adjacency matrix and check for validity of each pair in the list.
#### Day 6
- BFS can be used in part 1. 
- Brute force can be used in part 2 by checking for all positions if adding an obstacle leads to a cycle. Cycle can be detected by maintaining if we have already visited a cell with the same directional vectors.
